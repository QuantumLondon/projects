# Pricing European Call Options

This project focuses on real life applications of quantum computing in the world of finance.

The first subject that we chose is **Pricing European Call Options**. You can read about it here:

- Option Pricing using Quantum Computers, Stamatopoulos et al. 2019 (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02666v5>)
- Quantum Risk Analysis. Woerner, Egger. 2018 (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06893>)

The tutorial we'll use as guidelines for this project can be found here:

<https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/finance/03_european_call_option_pricing.html>

There is also channel (option_pricing_project) on **Quantum London Slack workspace**. Please refer to that when regarding the discussions for this project.

## Zoom meeting on 2021-03-29

### Summary

After a brief introduction, the group discussed the possibilities of workflow based on the content of paper (*Option Pricing using Quantum Computers*). Anuj proposed that we first use Qiskit framework, and then switch to PennyLane (<https://pennylane.ai/>) with the more complex projects.

We agreed to start with simplest option pricing example, so we can recreate it more explicit (as the tutorial is too abstract), and try to make it scalable in the future. Discussions, progress and goals achieved from each session will be tracked here on GitHub and on:

## Goals

- [x] create Slack channel
- [x] create GitHub repository
- [x] invite other QL members
- [ ] read, understand, and write Qiskit code that's recreating tutorials functionality regarding pricing options
- [ ] discuss the code in Slack
- [ ] Zoom meeting at 8th of April (<https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82455351865?pwd=SnVMVFY0aGF0Q3BLbjN6SmJrTmtmQT09>)
- [ ] Update each meeting session summary at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEbjgZFuukovSlC3hvvveXQIJc4cHgKhbnoWPFGfnWI/edit>
